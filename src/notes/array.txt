1) Can you pass the negative number as an array size?
	-> No. You can’t pass the negative integer as an array size. If you pass, there will be no compile time error but you will
	   get NegativeArraySizeException at run time.
	   
2) Can you change the size of the array once you define it? OR Can you insert or delete the elements after creating an array?
	-> No, You can’t change the size of the array once you define it. 
	-> You can not insert or delete the elements after creating an array. Only you can do is change the value of the elements.
	
3) What is an anonymous array? Give example?
	-> Anonymous array is an array without reference. For example,

		public class MainClass
		{
		    public static void main(String[] args)
		    {
		        //Creating anonymous arrays
		  
		        System.out.println(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.length);    //Output : 5
		  
		        System.out.println(new int[]{21, 14, 65, 24, 21}[1]);   //Output : 14
		    }
		}
		
4) What is the difference between int[] a and int a[] ?
	-> Both are the legal methods to declare the arrays in java.
	
5) There are two array objects of int type. one is containing 100 elements and another one is containing 10 elements. 
   Can you assign array of 100 elements to an array of 10 elements?
   
   	-> Yes, you can assign array of 100 elements to an array of 10 elements provided they should be of same type. 
   	   While assigning, compiler checks only type of the array not the size.
   	   
		public class MainClass
		{
		    public static void main(String[] args)
		    {
		        int[] a = new int[10];
		         
		        int[] b = new int[100];
		         
		        a = b;      //Compiler checks only type, not the size
		    }
		}
   
6) “int a[] = new int[3]{1, 2, 3}” – is it a legal way of defining the arrays in java?
	-> No. You should not mention the size of the array when you are providing the array contents.
   
7) Array:
	- Arrays are of fixed length.
	- You can’t change the size of the array once you create it.
	- Array does not support generics.
	- You can use arrays to store both primitive types as well as reference types.
	
8) ArrayList:
	- ArrayList is of variable length.
	- Size of the ArrayList grows and shrinks as you add or remove the elements.
	- ArrayList supports generics.
	- You can store only reference types in an ArrayList.
	
9) What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
There are four methods available in java to copy an array.
	1) Using for loop
	2) Using Arrays.copyOf() method
	3) Using System.arraycopy() method
	4) Using clone() method 
   
10) What are jagged arrays in java? Give example?
	-> Jagged arrays in java are the arrays containing arrays of different length. Jagged arrays are also multidimensional 
	   arrays. They are also called as ragged arrays.
	   
11) How do you check the equality of two arrays in java? OR How do you compare the two arrays in java?
	-> You can use Arrays.equals() method to compare one dimensional arrays and to compare multidimensional arrays, use 
	   Arrays.deepEquals() method.
	   
12) What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
	-> ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is a run time exception which occurs when your program tries to access invalid index 
	   of an array i.e negative index or index higher than the size of the array.
   
13) While creating the multidimensional arrays, can you specify an array dimension after an empty dimension?
	-> No. You can not specify an array dimension after an empty dimension while creating multidimensional arrays. It gives 
	   compile time error.  
	   
14) What value does array elements get, if they are not initialized?
	-> If we don’t assign values to array elements, and try to access them, compiler does not produce error as in case of 
	   simple variables. Instead it assigns values which aren’t garbage.
	-> They get default values.
	
		boolean : false
		int : 0
		double : 0.0
		String : null
		User Defined Type : null
	
15) What are the drawbacks of the arrays in java?
	-> The main drawback of the arrays is that arrays are of fixed size. You can’t change the size of the array once you 
	   create it. Therefore, you must know how many elements you want in an array before creating it. You can’t insert or 
	   delete the elements once you create an array. Only you can do is change the value of the elements.
	   
	-> Arrays are Strongly Typed.
	Arrays does not have add or remove methods.
	We need to mention the size of the array. Fixed length. So there is a chance of memory wastage.
	To delete an element in an array we need to traverse through out the array so this will reduce performance.
   
16) Where does an array stored in memory?
	-> An array is created in the heap space of JVM memory. Since an array is an object in Java, even if you create array 
	   locally inside a method or block, an object is always allocated memory from the heap.
	   
How to Remove Elements?
	-> In java we can’t delete an item in 2d arrays. 2-dimensional arrays are nothing but an array of arrays. But there is a
	   way to remove that element via replacing the places.
